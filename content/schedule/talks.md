<h2>
Talk:
<a id="xfail">xfail and skip: What to do with tests you know will fail</a>
</h2>
<p>
What do you do with a test you know will fail? Skip it? Mark it as xfail? Or wait until the test is passing before adding it to your test suite?

In this talk, I’ll explain `pytest`’s `skipif` and `xfail`, and dive into various strategies for dealing with tests that will not pass.
